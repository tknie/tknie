# Hi all 😄

## Introduction

I've worked since 1995 with/on Linux in University and since 2000 as a developer in C- and Java-based projects.
In-between the Java on Mainframe (z/OS) was a insight into Big Iron. The Adabas-Go-API works on Windows, Linux, Unix and z/OS Java.

For Microservice topics I use the Golang language. It does fit to Microservice models and is easy to use and maintain.

## Private projects

The Github projects are for **_personal_** private projects only. I'm working in an Software Architect planning are.
The projects are managed for tooling, private web tools, testing purposes or just for fun.

## I’m currently working on

I need a SQL- or NoSQL-based database layer for a private adaption of the bitgarten project. This layer should be able to use either MariaDB, Postgres or MongoDB.
In addition I'm working on an secure dynamic RESTful API access for any of the database types.

My favorite programming topics are

- C
- Golang
- Java
- Javascript/Typescript
  - Vue
  - Angular
- Microservices (Docker)
- Google Cloud
- Github Actions

## Past business

In the past I developed various Adabas specific projects reflecting in the Software AG user [thknieling](https://github.com/thknieling). These projects are managed and **supported** by [Software AG](https://github.com/SoftwareAG). I left the company and do not have access to licenses anymore.

Only for Adabas-GO-API I did some minor changes because of maintenace.
