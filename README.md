### Hi all ðŸ˜„

I've worked with/on Linux since 1995 and as a developer since 2000. Currently the GIThub projects are for **_personal_** private projects only. I'm working as a Software Architect or Technology Lead and so this is fun for me.

#### Iâ€™m currently working on

I need a SQL- or NoSQL-based database layer for a private adaption of the picture storage and management project. This layer should be able to use either MariaDB, Postgres or MongoDB.
In addition I'm working on an dynamic RESTful access for any of the database types.
My favorite programming topics are

- C
- Golang
- Java
- ViewJS

All projects run in Microservices (Docker, podman, Cloud).

#### Past business

In the past I developed various Adabas specific projects reflecting in the Software AG user [thknieling](https://github.com/thknieling). These projects are managed and **supported** by [Software AG](https://github.com/SoftwareAG). I left the company and do not have access to licenses anymore.

Software AG projects were

- Adabas GO API
- Adabas admin RESTful client
- Adabas RESTful web application

Only for Adabas-GO-API I did some minor changes because of performance after I left the company. Due to a missing Adabas license the work is reduced to Adabas Community Edition version topics.
