### Hi all ðŸ˜„

I've worked since 1995 with/on Linux and since 2000 as a developer. Currently the GIThub projects are for **_personal_** private projects only. I'm working as a Software Architect and so this is fun for me.

#### Iâ€™m currently working on

I need a SQL- or NoSQL-based database layer for a private adaption of the adabas-bitgarten project. This layer should be able to use either MariaDB, Postgres or MongoDB.
In addition I'm working on an dynamic RESTful access for any of the database types.
My favorite programming topics are

- C
- Golang
- Java
- ViewJS
- Microservices (Docker)

#### Past business

In the past I developed various Adabas specific projects reflecting in the Software AG user [thknieling](https://github.com/thknieling). These projects are managed and **supported** by [Software AG](https://github.com/SoftwareAG). I left the company and do not have access to licenses anymore.

Software AG projects were

- Adabas GO API
- Adabas admin RESTful client
- Adabas RESTful web application

Only for Adabas-GO-API I did some minor changes because of performance. Due to a missing Adabas license the work is reduced to Adabas Community Edition version topics.
