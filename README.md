# Hi all 😄

I've worked since 1995 with/on Linux operating systems. First during my study I worked at University at computer center. Besides Linux I worked with other Unix operating systems like SUN, SGI, AIX or HP-UX, later in my job.
At 2000 I start working as a developer in projects developed in C- and Java outside the University. In-between the Java on Mainframe (z/OS) was my insight into Big Iron. 
I started working with the Golang language. Finally I got a working Adabas-API in Golang and Java running on Windows, Linux, Unix and z/OS.

Linux was key for Microservice containers for Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud systems. It became more and more part of my work. For these Microservice environments I use the Golang language. It does fit well to Microservice pattern and is easy to use and maintain.

At the moment I plan and manage topics like Sofware designs and future-proof developments in various areas of big and complex environments.
I need to work enabling future development into projects even by budget constraints. That's what I've done my whole development time.

## Private projects

The Github projects are for **_personal_** private usage only. I'm working in an Software Architect planning area.
The projects are managed for tooling, private web tools, testing purposes or just for fun.
Some are documented at [Bitgarten](https:/bitgarten.de) .

## I’m currently working on

I need a SQL- or NoSQL-based database layer for a private adaption of the bitgarten project. This layer should be able to use either MariaDB, Postgres or MongoDB.
For that I'm working on an secure dynamic RESTful API access for any of the common used database types.

Because of solar panels I own I developed some tracking tools to notice each Watt generated into a databases. This I use to display it in Grafana. This tools track and combine energy tracker and solar panel data.

My favorite programming languages and tools are

- C
- Golang
- Java
- Javascript/Typescript
  - Vue
  - Angular
- Microservices (Docker)
- Google Cloud
- Github Actions
- Terraform

All projects run in Microservices (Docker, podman, Cloud(AWS,Google Cloud, Azure)).

## Past business

In the past I developed various Software AG products especially Adabas specific tools. They are reflected in the Software AG user [thknieling](https://github.com/thknieling). These projects are managed and **supported** by [Software AG](https://github.com/SoftwareAG). I left the company and do not have access to licenses anymore.
